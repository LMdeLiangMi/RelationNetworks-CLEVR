# Relational Networks CLEVR
A pytorch implementation for _A simple neural network module for relational reasoning_ [https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01427](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01427), working on the CLEVR dataset.

This code tries to reproduce results obtained by DeepMind team. Since the paper does not expose all the network details, there could be variations to respect the original results.

The model can be trained with a slightly modified version of RN, called IR, that enables relational features extraction in order to perform Relational Content Based Image Retrieval (R-CBIR).

## Get the data

Download and extract CLEVR_v1.0 dataset: http://cs.stanford.edu/people/jcjohns/clevr/

## Train

The training code can be run both using Docker or standard python installation with pytorch.
If Docker is used, an image is built with all needed dependencies and it can be easily run inside a Docker container.

### Without Docker
Simply move to the cloned directory and issue the command:

```sh
$ python3 train.py --clevr-dir /path/to/clevr_dataset/CLEVR_v1.0
```
In order to use the IR architecture for features extraction:
```sh
$ python3 train.py --clevr-dir /path/to/clevr_dataset/CLEVR_v1.0 --model original
```

To explore a bunch of other possible arguments useful to customize training, issue the command:
```sh
$ python3 train.py --help
```

### With Docker
To build and execute the docker image, move to the cloned directory and issue the following commands

```sh
$ ./docker_build.sh
$ ./docker_run.sh /path/to/clevr_dataset/CLEVR_v1.0
```

By default, the training is performed with mini-batches of size 64 and for a maximum of 200 epochs.
If multiple GPUs are used or some specific parameters for the `main.py` script are needed, it is required to slightly modify the `docker_run.sh` script.

## Features extraction for R-CBIR
Once architecture has been trained with ```--model ir``` option, features can be extracted using the following command:
```sh
$ python3 extract.py --clevr-dir /path/to/clevr_dataset/CLEVR_v1.0 --model ir --checkpoint model*/RN_epoch_#.pth --layer g_fc4:o
```
Where ```--layer g_fc4:o``` extracts features from the output of the g_fc4 layer. Use ```:i``` for input.


## Implementation details
* Questions and answers dictionaries are built from data in training set, so the model will not work with words never seen before.
* All the words in the dataset are treated in a case-insensitive manner, since we don't want the model to learn case biases.
* For network settings, see sections 6B and 6C from the original paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01427.
